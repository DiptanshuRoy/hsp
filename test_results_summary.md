- **Details**: 
  - FastAPI app imports correctly with path `app.main:app`
  - Application structure follows Python packaging conventions
  - No import errors when starting uvicorn server
  - App title and version are correctly configured

### ✅ 2. Test prediction endpoint with sample data when model is present
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Details**:
  - Prediction endpoint returns HTTP 200 when model is loaded
  - Response contains `readmission_prediction` field
  - Sample prediction successfully processed
  - Model loading confirmation displayed in logs

### ✅ 3. Test error handling when model file is missing
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Details**:
  - Application starts successfully even without model file
  - Clear warning messages displayed when model is missing
  - Prediction endpoint returns HTTP 503 Service Unavailable
  - Appropriate error message: "Model not loaded. Please train the model first and restart the server."

### ✅ 4. Confirm API documentation is accessible at `/docs` endpoint
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Details**:
  - `/docs` endpoint returns HTTP 200
  - Documentation contains correct API title: "Hospital Readmission Prediction API"
  - Swagger UI properly formatted and accessible
  - `/openapi.json` endpoint also accessible with correct schema

## Requirements Verification

All specified requirements have been successfully verified:

- **1.1**: ✅ uvicorn starts without import errors using new structure
- **1.2**: ✅ Model loading with proper error handling
- **1.3**: ✅ API documentation accessible at `/docs` endpoint
- **2.1**: ✅ Proper module structure (app/main.py)
- **2.2**: ✅ Standard import path (app.main:app)
- **4.1**: ✅ Clear error messages for missing model
- **4.2**: ✅ Appropriate error response when model is missing
- **4.3**: ✅ Model loading confirmation when present

## Additional Validations

- ✅ Startup script validation works correctly
- ✅ Python environment check passes
- ✅ Package structure follows conventions
- ✅ Error handling is graceful and informative
- ✅ API endpoints respond correctly in both success and error scenarios

## Conclusion

The complete application structure has been thoroughly tested and all functionality works as expected. The FastAPI application can start successfully, handle both model-present and model-missing scenarios gracefully, and provides proper API documentation.
