# Product Overview

This is a hospital readmission prediction system that uses machine learning to predict whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days based on hospital records.

## Key Features
- XGBoost-based classification model for readmission prediction
- FastAPI web service for real-time predictions
- Data processing pipeline for feature engineering
- Jupyter notebook-based exploration and experimentation

## Target Use Case
Healthcare providers can use this system to identify high-risk patients and implement preventive measures to reduce readmission rates, improving patient outcomes and reducing costs.

## Model Performance
The system uses XGBoost with optimized hyperparameters (200 estimators, max depth 5, learning rate 0.1) trained on processed hospital record features.
