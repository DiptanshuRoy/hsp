# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current FastAPI application has structural issues that prevent it from running properly. The module import path doesn't match the actual file structure, causing `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.app'` when trying to start the server. This feature will reorganize the API structure to follow Python packaging best practices and ensure the application can start successfully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the FastAPI application to have a proper module structure, so that I can start the server without import errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the uvicorn command `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` is executed THEN the system SHALL start the FastAPI server successfully
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load the trained model from the models directory
3. WHEN the model file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display a clear warning message and continue running with graceful error handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API structure to follow Python packaging conventions, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the app directory structure THEN the system SHALL have a single main.py file at the root of the app directory
2. WHEN importing the FastAPI app THEN the system SHALL use the standard import path `app.main:app`
3. WHEN the application is structured THEN the system SHALL eliminate redundant nested app directories

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the startup script to use the correct import path, so that the application starts without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the run_system.sh script THEN the system SHALL use the correct uvicorn import path
2. WHEN the script executes THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about the server startup process
3. WHEN the model is missing THEN the system SHALL still attempt to start the server with appropriate warnings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API to handle missing model files gracefully, so that the application doesn't crash during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model file is missing THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with instructions
2. WHEN a prediction request is made without a loaded model THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response
3. WHEN the model loads successfully THEN the system SHALL confirm the model is ready for predictions
